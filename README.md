VolunBee is a volunteering and community engagement platform where volunteers can offer a helping hand to those in need, test and share their knowledge, and connect with fellow volunteers. The app serves two types of users: volunteers and help seekers. Help seekers can request assistance by specifying their needs and the type of volunteers required.
The name VolunBee combines the words "Volunteer" and "Bee". Bees symbolize teamwork and generosity; they work together harmoniously and help each other accomplish their tasks. This reflects the core values of the platform which is collaboration, support, and community spirit.
